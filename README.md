# Literary Hub ðŸ“š

Literary Hub is a Spotify x Tik Tok take on poetry that lets you read public domain poetry, learn about it, and curate your own collections of your favorite poems. In an effort to make reading poetry more accessible and engaging, Literary Hub is helping to bring poetry back into our modern, everyday lives.

On our home page, users can enjoy an infinite scroll of personalized recommended poems. The explore page allows users to discover new authors and trending collections, along with accessing the Poem of the Day feature. Your profile page serves as a hub for your collections and likes, showcasing your statistics including poems read and comments made.
